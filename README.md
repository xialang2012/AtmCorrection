## Introduction
This code is used to perform a quick atmospheric correction for MODIS L1B data (HDF4). The theory and parameters of the atmospheric correction can be found from NASA.

## How to Run
You should clone the code firstly.
```
git clone https://github.com/xialang2012/atmCorrection.git.
```
Then these libraries should be installed.
```
a. numpy
b. pyhdf
c. scipy
```
Finally run the command, e.g. 
```
python ref.py
```

## Where can I get the MODIS data
You can download it from https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/search/.
