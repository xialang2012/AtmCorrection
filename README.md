1. This code is used to perform a quick atmoepheric correction for MODIS L1B data (HDF4). The theory and parameters of the atmospheric correction can be found from NASA.

2. How to Run? First, you should clone the code to your local, using git clone https://github.com/xialang2012/atmCorrection.git.
Then, above libraries should be installed: 
a. numpy
b. pyhdf
c. scipy
Finally, run the command, e.g. python ref.py

3. Where can I get the MODIS data?
You can download it from https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/search/.
